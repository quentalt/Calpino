Welcome to my Calpino note-taking app! This app is designed to help you easily take and organize notes on your computer (soon mobile device). Here's a quick overview of the app's features:

* Note creation: You can create new notes by clicking the "New Note" button or pressing the "N" key on your keyboard.

* Note editing: To edit an existing note, simply click on it in the list of notes. You can also use the search bar to quickly find a specific note.

* Note formatting: You can format your notes using basic text formatting tools, such as bold, italic, and underline. You can also insert images and attachments.

That's it! We hope you find our app useful and intuitive. If you have any questions or feedback, please don't hesitate to contact us. Happy note-taking!

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
